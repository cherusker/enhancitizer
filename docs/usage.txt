Usage: enhancitizer [Options] [PROJECT-ROOT] [OUTPUT-FOLDER] [LOGFILES] ...

  Enhance the reports of various Clang sanitizers.

Arguments:

  PROJECT-ROOT   The root directory (absolute, or relative to this program) of
                 the project that has been analysed with Clang. It is
                 important, that this argument matches the file paths that can
                 be found in Clang's stack traces.

  OUTPUT-FOLDER  This is where all the magic goes.

  LOGFILES       Locations of log files that contain stack traces of Clang
                 sanitizers. These paths can either point to files or to
                 directories. If an argument points to a directory, all
                 containing files and directories will be treated as if they
                 were arguments themselves.

Options:

     --clean     Start with a clean OUTPUT-FOLDER; empty it if necessary.
     --debug     Show debugging information.
     --minimal   Hide detailed information of the tasks.
  -v --version   Print the version information.
