Usage: ./enhancitizer.py [OPTIONS] [PROJECT-ROOT] [LOGFILE] [OUTPUT-FOLDER]

  Enhance the reports of various Clang sanitizers.

Arguments:

  PROJECT-ROOT   The root directory (absolute, or relative to this program) of
                 the project that has been analysed with Clang. It is
                 important, that this argument matches the file paths that can
                 be found in Clang's stack traces.
  LOGFILE        Location of the log file that contains stack traces of Clang.
  OUTPUT-FOLDER  This is where all the magic goes. If omitted, it will be set
                 to "enhancitizer".

Options:

  -v --version   Print the version information.
